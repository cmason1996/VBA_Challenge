# Overview of Project

## Objective
The objective of this project was to refactor the original macro created for Steve. Originally the code was written to collect desired information from the "Stocks 2017" and "Stocks 2018" workbooks. By refactoring the code it was made more flexible and was allowed to run more efficiently. This transformation is desriable to Steve as it allows him to run the data repeatedly with ease while still gathering the desired information and reducing the workload on his local machine.

## Data
The original data sets where gathered from 12 different stocks that contained their ticker, opeing price, the high and low price for a given day, the closing price, adjusted close price, the volume of shares traded, and the date they the transactions took place. For the purposes of this analysis, we were only interesting in the ticker, the total volume of daily trades, and the return of each stock.

# Procedure
The refactoring began with taking the original code and outining the sections that needed to be adjusted to make the code become more efficient. Using comments, the sections where outlines and labelled for ease of identification later should the code need to be refactored or adjusted later on to fit rising needs. Below is a snapshot of the main body of code after it had been refactored, with comments:
